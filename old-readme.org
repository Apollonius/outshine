/[Emacs] outline with outshine outshines outline/

* outshine.el

*outshine* is an extension to the Emacs (minor) mode 'outline.el'. It is
based on, and a merge of, 'outline-magic.el' from /Carsten Dominik/ and
'outxxtra.el', which is itself a modified extension of 'out-xtra.el' from
/Per Abrahamsen/. 

Use this in your .emacs:

#+begin_example
(require 'outshine)

(add-hook 'outline-minor-mode-hook 'outshine-hook-function)

;; maybe this:

(add-hook 'outline-minor-mode-hook (lambda () (define-key outline-minor-mode-map (kbd "<tab>") 'outline-cycle)))

;; and maybe, just as an example, this too:

(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'outline-minor-mode)
#+end_example
